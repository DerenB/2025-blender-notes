# Sushi

- Create cube
- Squish height to size
- Subdivide
  - Edit mode
  - `RMB` > subdivide
  - Do Twice
- Extrude interior
  - extrude `e` the interior squares inward to create layer
- Extrude perimeter
  - `alt` select all of the exterior faces
  - Warning:
    - using extrude `e` then cancelling with `RMB` still creates the new vertices
    - have to be careful or merge at distance afterwards to fix
  - `ALT + E` > Extrude Faces ALong Normals
    - Normals are the direction that an object is facing
  - Use `S` scale to extrude out evenly
- Extrude new perimeter upwards
